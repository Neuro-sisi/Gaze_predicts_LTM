This code links to the preprint: 'Tracking how attentional focusing in working memory benefits long-term memory' in bioRxiv https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2024.03.25.586271v1.abstract. In this project, we found that attentional prioritization within working memory instills long-term memory performance. By recording observers' eye movements during working memory, we found a direct association between the efficiency of attentional deployment -- indexed by the latency of saccade bias -- and subsequent long-term memory performance.
